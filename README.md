# PopLibrary

The PopLibrary application is a project that will eventually serve as a library for school needs. It will work as a standard library, but it will be free to use. It will integrate tightly with Amazon to provide clean images, descriptions, and titles as well the ability to obtain additional books.

Two previous attempts were made to implement this. However, due to security concerns the desktop application design was abandoned. Moving forward, we plan to develop this as a web-based application linked to your Cybrotronics account.
