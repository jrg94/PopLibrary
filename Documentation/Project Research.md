* Purchased a scanner from Amazon by WoneNice – the scanner itself has no name but the pamphlet it came with has the words “ARM 32-bit Cortex V3.10” stamped on every page
	* I have no idea how to set this thing up – the documentation has no directions – just a set of barcodes with labels such as language and print settings
	* I have spent some time researching how to get this device to pair with the BarcodeScanner API for C# - it is not going well – turns out the scanner needs to be configured as a HID.scanner not an HID.keyboard – I can’t seem to change it
* I am using Visual Studio to build a Windows 8.1 application – XAML is proving to be annoying already, but I have been watching tutorials on how to setup a Universal project (assuming I want to port this to a Windows phone)
